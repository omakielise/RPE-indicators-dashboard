# RPE Indicators Dashboard

The Indicators Dashboard displays data from state-level indicators of sexual violence. It can be customized to incorporate data on multiple risk and protective factors, over multiple years and for various demographic groups as needed. It has two components:
* The Indicator Tracking Tool is a solution to harmonize and track indicators from diverse data sources over time. It ensures consistency and machine-readability to streamline querying, summarizing and vizualizing data. Data can be entered on the Template sheet with additional options for years and demographic variables and categories added to the Dropdown Categories sheet.   
* The R markdown files are a companion to the Indicator Tracking Tool to build an interactive dashboard in Shiny. The "Dashboard Demonstration" is limited to one variable, two years and two demographic groups as pre-populated into the Indicator Tracking Tool, Demo sheet. The "RPE Indicator Dashboard" is an extended version with code for six different varibales, three years of data and four demographic groups.

The dashboard was designed specific for the Maryland Rape Prevention Education program, but can be fitted to other state's indicators.

Note: All data in the Indicator Tracking Tool is falsified for purporses of public release and demonstration.
